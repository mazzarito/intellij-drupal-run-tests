# How to contribute

This project started out as a way to lower the setup barrier to get users running tests for Drupal. However, it can only
grow through user contributions via bug reports, feature requests, and (if you can) pull requests.

## Getting Started

* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
