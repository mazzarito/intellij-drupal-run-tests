[Drupal Test Runner][home]
==================

by [Matt Glaman][glamanate]

With Drupal Test Runner, a new run configuration is added to PhpStorm specifically for Drupal's test running script
`run-tests.sh`. This allows you to run Simpletest, Unit, Kernel, Functional, and FunctionalJavascript tests with one
 single runner.

## Installing the plugin
Currently the plugin is being developed and is not yet published on the JetBrains plugin repositories. You will
need to clone the repository and build the project.

* @todo: Add a link to a Dropbox .zip file of the built project
* @todo: Publish

## Using the plugin

* @todo document and screenshot the usage

## Contributing

* @todo document how to setup environment, because documentation kind of stinks on it
