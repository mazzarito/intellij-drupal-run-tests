[Drupal Test Runner][home]
==================

by [Matt Glaman][glamanate]

With Drupal Test Runner, a new run configuration is added to PhpStorm specifically for Drupal's test running script
`run-tests.sh`. This allows you to run Simpletest, Unit, Kernel, Functional, and FunctionalJavascript tests with one
 single runner.
